Project 60: AI-powered Smart Grid Energy Management 
● Project Title: GridSense: AI-powered Smart Grid Energy Management 
● Project Summary: Develop an AI-powered system that optimizes energy distribution 
and consumption within a simulated smart grid. The system aims to balance supply and 
demand, integrate renewable energy sources, and minimize energy waste by making 
intelligent decisions based on consumption patterns and generation forecasts. 
● Description: GridSense will simulate a small smart grid network with various energy 
sources (e.g., traditional grid, solar, wind) and consumers (e.g., homes, businesses). It 
will use machine learning algorithms (e.g., time series forecasting, optimization 
algorithms) to predict energy demand and renewable energy generation. Based on these 
predictions, the system will dynamically manage energy flow, prioritize renewable 
sources, and potentially suggest load shifting to consumers. A dashboard will visualize 
energy flow and optimization results. 
● Problem Statement: Traditional power grids are often inefficient, struggle to integrate 
intermittent renewable energy sources, and lack the intelligence to respond dynamically 
to supply and demand fluctuations. This leads to energy waste, instability, and higher 
costs. 
● Proposed Solution: Implement an AI-driven smart grid management system that uses 
predictive analytics and optimization to intelligently balance energy supply and demand. 
By integrating renewables and optimizing distribution, the system enhances grid 
efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. 
● Project Objectives: 
○ To design and implement a simulation environment for a smart grid. 
○ To collect simulated energy consumption and generation data. 
○ To select and implement an AI algorithm for energy forecasting and optimization.

○ To demonstrate optimized energy distribution and reduced waste. 
● Scope of the Project: Simulation of a micro-grid with 2-3 energy sources (e.g., grid, 
solar) and 2-3 consumers. Simulated time-series data for consumption and generation. 
Implementation of a basic time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for 
demand/supply prediction and a simple optimization algorithm (e.g., linear programming, 
rule-based) for energy dispatch. Python-based simulation and visualization.
